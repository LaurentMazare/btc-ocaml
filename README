1. Overview
-----------
btc-ocaml is a toy implementation of the bitcoin p2p protocol. For now it just connects to
the bitcoin network and downloads the block headers for the full blockchain.
Note that this is very experimental so bugs should be expected and in particular the
downloaded blockchain should not be considered as the consensus blockchain as there is no
proper check for this!

2. Building
-----------
btc-ocaml can be built using opam on a linux platform as follows.
  A. Install the following dependencies using opam as well as ocaml 4.01:
    - cryptokit (1.10)
    - core (111.28.01)
    - async (111.25.00)
  B. Build btc.native via the following command line:
    corebuild btc.native -pkgs core -pkgs async -pkgs cryptokit

3. Running
----------
First run the following command to obtain a list of possibles node to connect to.
  dig seed.bitcoin.sipa.be
Then run btc.native on any of the ip addresses returned by dig, the -blockchain flag is
used to specify a file where the blockchain can be store and accessed.
  ./btc.native X.X.X.X -blockchain ./blockchain.bin
